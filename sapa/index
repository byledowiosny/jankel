;  index for the sapaclisp contribution to StatLib, Version 1.0, 3 June 1993
;
;  sapaclisp is a collection of Common Lisp functions that can be used
;  to carry out many of the computations described in the book
;     "Spectral Analysis for Physical Applications: Multitaper and
;      Conventional Univariate Techniques",
;     by Donald B. Percival and Andrew T. Walden,
;     Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 1993
;  (we refer to this book later on as "the SAPA book").
;  Questions concerning these Lisp functions can be addressed to
;  Don Percival via electronic mail at the Internet address
;             dbp@apl.washington.edu
;  or via traditional mail at the address
;             Donald B. Percival
;             Applied Physics Laboratory
;             HN-10
;             University of Washington
;             Seattle, WA  98195
;  The SAPA book uses a number of time series as examples
;  of various spectral analysis techniques.  The most important of
;  these series are also available from StatLib by sending the command
;             send sapa from datasets
;  to the Internet address
;             statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu
; 
;  Version 1.0 of the sapaclisp contribution consists of this index
;  and the following 16 files:
;   [ 1]  sapa-package
;   [ 2]  hacks
;   [ 3]  utilities
;   [ 4]  basic-math
;   [ 5]  matrix
;   [ 6]  basic-statistics
;   [ 7]  dft-and-fft
;   [ 8]  tapers
;   [ 9]  filtering
;   [10]  random
;   [11]  acvs
;   [12]  parametric
;   [13]  nonparametric
;   [14]  multitaper
;   [15]  harmonic
;   [16]  examples
;  All 16 files can be obtaining by sending the command
;             send everything from sapaclisp
;  to the Internet address
;             statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu
;  Individual files can be obtained by sending a command such as
;             send dft-and-fft from sapaclisp
;  to the same address.
;
;  Here is a brief description of the contents of each file:
;   [ 1]  sapa-package contains Lisp forms needed to create
;         the package SAPA (packages are mysterious and tricky
;         creatures in Common Lisp that serve a noble purpose,
;         namely, to make sure that different collections of
;         Lisp functions can gracefully live together).  All
;         of the Lisp functions in the sapaclisp contribution
;         live in the SAPA package.  You should compile and load
;         this file before trying to do ANYTHING from within Lisp
;         with the other files (including viewing them with a
;         Lisp-oriented text editor!).
;   [ 2]  hacks at present patches up faulty definitions for map-into
;         in Allegro Common Lisp and in the Genera 8.1 version of Common Lisp
;         (if you are using Macintosh Common Lisp, you can ignore this file).
;   [ 3]  utilities contains a collection of utility functions
;         that are used extensively throughout SAPA.  These are mostly
;         functions for manipulating various sequences of data, but
;         there are also functions for converting back and from
;         decibels, a Lisp implementation of the Fortran sign function, etc.
;   [ 4]  basic-math contains functions for supporting certain
;         basic mathematical operations such as computing the log
;         of the gamma function, manipulating polynomials, root finding
;         and simple numerical integration.
;   [ 5]  matrix contains functions for manipulating matrices, including
;         the Cholesky and modified Gram-Schmidt (i.e., Q-R) decompositions.
;   [ 6]  basic-statistics contains functions to carry out basic
;         statistical operations, such as sample means and variances,
;         sample medians, computation of quantiles from various distributions,
;         linear least squares, etc.
;   [ 7]  dft-and-fft contains functions for computing the discrete Fourier
;         transform of a vector of numbers via a fast Fourier transform
;         algorithm or a chirp transform algorithm.
;   [ 8]  tapers contains functions for computing the cosine and dpss
;         data tapers and applying them to a time series.
;   [ 9]  filtering contains functions that approximate ideal low-pass,
;         high-pass and band-pass filters using techniques outlined
;         in Chapter 5 of the SAPA book.  It also has functions for
;         some simple smoothers.
;   [10]  random contains functions for generating realizations of
;         various stationary processes.
;   [11]  acvs contains functions for computing the sample autocovariance
;         sequence and sample variogram for a time series.
;   [12]  parametric contains functions for computing autoregressive
;         spectral estimates using a variety of techniques, including
;         the Yule-Walker method, Burg's algorithm, forward least squares
;         and forward/backward least squares (these are discussed in
;         Chapter 9 of the SAPA book).
;   [13]  nonparametric contains functions for computing nonparametric
;         spectral estimates, including the periodogram, direct spectral
;         estimates, lag window spectral estimates and WOSA spectral
;         estimates.  There are also functions for computing the sample
;         cepstrum, the time series bandwidth and the cumulative periodogram
;         test statistic for white noise (all of these are discussed
;         in Chapter 6 of the SAPA book).
;   [14]  multitaper contains functions for computing the orthonormal
;         dpss data tapers and both the simple and adaptive multitaper
;         spectral estimates (discussed in Chapters 7 and 8 of the SAPA book).
;   [15]  harmonic contains functions for computing the cosine and
          sine component of the periodogram and Fisher's g statistic
          (discussed in Chapter 10 of the SAPA book).
;   [16]  examples contains just that: some examples of how to use
;         the functions in SAPA to reproduce some of the results in
;         the SAPA book.
;  All exported functions in SAPA have a documentation line that tells
;  how to use them.  In addition, almost all functions have a brief
;  example of their use immediately following the definition of the
;  the function.  You can repeat these examples by evaluating the
;  appropriate Lisp forms.  Note: some of these Lisp forms return
;  a short vector, the contents of which can be examined easily
;  by setting the Common Lisp variable *print-array* to t prior to
;  evaluating the Lisp form (see page 565 of the second edition of
;  "Common Lisp: The Language" by Guy Steele, Digital Press, 1990 --
;  we refer to this book later on as "Steele2").
;
;  Here are the steps to take to prepare the SAPA files for use.
;   [ 1]  Retrieve all 16 files from StatLib, and place them on your
;         computer in 16 individual files.  As an example, let's
;         assume that the files are named
;              sapa-package.lisp
;              hacks.lisp
;              utilities.lisp
;                  ...
;              harmonic.lisp
;              examples.lisp
;         The first line in each file should have some gunk on it
;         concerning Mode, Package and Syntax.
;   [ 2]  Bring up Lisp on your computer.
;   [ 3]  Compile sapa-package.lisp, and then load it into your
;         Lisp world.  Here are examples of two Lisp forms that
;         will do this if you evaluate them:
;              (compile-file "sapa-package.lisp")
;              (load "sapa-package.fasl")
;         Here the function compile-file compiles the file sapa-package.lisp,
;         and the results of the compilation are placed in sapa-package.fasl.
;         The compiled version is then loaded into the Lisp world using
;         the load function.  Note that the ".lisp" and ".fasl" extensions
;         in this example may need to be changed to match the naming
;         conventions for source files and compiled binary files
;         in Lisp systems other than Macintosh Common Lisp 2.0.
;   [ 4]  Compile and load all the remaining files EXCEPT examples.lisp
;         in the order in which they are listed above (you can actually
;         compile and load these remaining files in any order if you
;         are willing to put up with snippy comments from certain compilers
;         about undefined functions).
;   [ 5]  To use the functions in SAPA, you must evaluate the following
;         Lisp form
;              (use-package :SAPA)
;         from within whatever package you plan to use the functions in the
;         SAPA package (usually this will be the package CL-USER).
;         This Lisp form is the second form in the file examples.lisp,
;         so you can just evaluate it there (that file does things in the
;         package CL-USER).  You can evaluate various forms given
;         in examples.lisp to learn how to use some of the SAPA functions.
;
;  For the record, the functions in the SAPA package have been tested
;  successfully in the following versions of Common Lisp:
;   [a]  Macintosh Common Lisp 2.0p2
;   [b]  Symbolics Genera 8.1.1 on a Symbolics MacIvory model 3
;   [c]  Allegro Common Lisp running under SunOS Release 4.1.2
;
;
;  Finally, here is some legal nonsense, shamelessly stolen from someone else
;  and placed here in an attempt to fend off lawyers (I don't know what it
;  means; I don't care what it means; I wasn't in my right mind when I did
;  all of this; I've NEVER been in my right mind; I'm not responsible
;  for anything I've ever done; the Devil made me do it; ... ):
